# GithubActions


GitHub Actions is a powerful and flexible continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) and automation platform provided by GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows for your projects, making it easier to build, test, and deploy your code directly from your GitHub repository.

Here's a basic guide to get you started with GitHub Actions:

1. Understanding Workflow Files:
GitHub Actions are defined in YAML files within a .github/workflows directory in your repository. These files define one or more workflows, each consisting of jobs and steps.

Workflow: A set of rules defining when the workflow should run and what actions to take.
Job: A set of steps that run in parallel on the same runner.
Step: An individual task within a job.
2. Creating a Workflow File:
Create a new file in your repository under .github/workflows. The file should have a .yml extension. For example, .github/workflows/main.yml.

3. Writing a Simple Workflow:
Here's a basic example that runs on every push to the repository:

```
name: Simple Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Run a simple command
      run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!"

```
